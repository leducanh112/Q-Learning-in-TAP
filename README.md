Apply Reinforcement Learning (Q-Learning) in Teaching Assignment Problem

The Teaching Assignment Problem (TAP) is a critical challenge faced by educational institutions, including universities, schools, and other academic organizations. It involves the optimal allocation of courses to instructors, considering their preferences and constraints, while ensuring fairness and efficiency in the teaching assignment process.
In a typical academic setting, there are multiple courses offered across various subjects and time slots. Additionally, instructors have preferences for specific subjects, course numbers, time slots, and teaching conditions. The objective of the TAP is to find an assignment that maximizes the overall quality of education, optimizes resource utilization, and ensures a balanced workload for instructors.
The main considerations in the Teaching Assignment Problem include:
  1. Instructor Preferences: Each instructor may have preferences for certain subjects and course levels, as well as time slots that align with their teaching style and expertise.
  2. Course Offerings: The educational institution offers a diverse range of courses across different subjects and levels.
  3. Time Constraints: The assignment must adhere to specific time slots and the overall academic schedule.
  4. Fairness: It is essential to ensure that the workload is distributed fairly among instructors, preventing overloading of some and under utilization of others.
  5. Optimal Resource Utilization: Efficiently allocating courses to instructors optimizes the use of available resources, such as classroom capacity and instructor expertise.
  6. Dynamic Changes:Course offerings and instructor availability may vary between semesters, necessitating flexibility in the assignment process.
